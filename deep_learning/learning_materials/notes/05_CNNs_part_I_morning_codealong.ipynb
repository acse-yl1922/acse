The reason for that is related to how the processes are forked using `copy-on-write`. In principle, copy-on-write should not happen as we are only accessing data, but in reality it does happen because we are modifying something called reference count which results in actual writes on the data we are reading, and that activates the `write` in the `copy-on-write`. The result of that is that as we are iterating over the dataloader, we start creating more and more memory copies of our data which eventually can throw an 'out memory error'.
