    "## Synopsis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the global and UK distribution of human habitation, flooding is one of the most common and impactful natural distasters which can occur. [Analysis of satellite data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w) coupled with [predictions on future changes](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/) to the climate suggest this is an issue which will only get more frequent and severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flooding can occur from a number of sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Surface water (from rainfall run-off, or from the fresh or dirty water systems)\n",
    "- Rivers, due to blockage or excess rainfall\n",
    "- Seas, due to sea level rise or storm surge.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This week we will concentrate on flooding ascribed to the latter two sources. Currently flood risk from rivers and seas in the UK is assessed in a number of ways using topographic data, large, complex numerical models and a large degree of human experience. It would be useful to have rapid tools leveraging ML teachniques to update risk assessments in piecemeal as new data is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to (a) develop prediction/classification routines for flood probability and impact for the UK, and (b) use this tool, together with rainfall and river level to provide a holistic tool to assess and analyse flood risk.\n"

    "## Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Samble datasets have been provided for you in the `flood_tools/resources` folder. These represent a subset of the test data which will be applied to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postcode data\n",
    "\n",
    "Three `.csv` files, `postcodes_sampled.csv`, `postcodes_unlabelled.csv` and `households per sector.csv` deal with information indexed by postcode, or postcode sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fully labelled `postcodes_sampled.csv` data provides a sample of labelled data for postcodes in England. The column headings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `postcode`: The full unit postcode for the row.\n",
    "- `sector`: The postcode sector for the row.\n",
    "- `easting`: The OS easting (in m) for the centroid of this postcode.\n",
    "- `northing`: The OS easting (in m) for the centroid of this postcode.\n",
    "- `altitude`: The height (in m) above sea level for the centroid of this postcode.`\n",
    "- `localAuthority` The Local Authority governing this postcode\n",
    "- `riskLabel` The probability class for flood risk for the postcode\n",
    "- `medianPrice` A typical house price (in Â£) for this postcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximate probabilities of flooding for the ten classes (in terms of the likelihood of at least one event in a given year) can be assumed to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Flood event|\n",
    "|:-----:| :---------:|\n",
    "| 10  | 5% |\n",
    "| 9   | 4% |\n",
    "| 8   | 3% |\n",
    "| 7   | 2%|\n",
    "| 6   | 1.5% |\n",
    "| 5   | 1% |\n",
    "| 4   | 0.5% |\n",
    "| 3 |  0.1% |\n",
    "| 2 | 0.05% |\n",
    "| 1 | 0.1% |\n",
    "\n",
    "So the lowest risk class expects one event in 1000 years (or longer) and the highest risk class expects one event in 20 years (or sooner).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `postcodes_unlabelled.csv` file in the `\\flood_tool/resources` directory provides an example of the input format to expect for unlabelled data. This shares its columns with the first 6 of the `postcodes_sampled.csv` file, but doesn't have risk class or house price data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `households per sector.csv` file contains information on the number of households in each postcode at the sector level, as well as the number of postcode units in each sector. This is a component of the impact factors involved in a flooding event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rain, river and tidal data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `typical_day.csv` and `wet_day.csv` files provide examples of UK rainfall information and river level taken from UK Environment Agency data. The columns are\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dateTime` The time for the reference.\n",
    "- `stationReference` The short code for the station\n",
    "- `parameter` The property being measured\n",
    "- `qualifier` Addditonal information on the measurement\n",
    "- `unitName` The unit of measurement, either millimeters (`mm`) for rain data or meters above a notional stage depth (mASD) for river data\n",
    "- `value` The actual measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rainfall data is primarily from tipping bucket rain gauges, which capture the height of the water column which has fallen at a given location over the 15 minute measurement period. River data is the instantaneous height of the river, with 0m being a \"standard\" height, and tidal data is with reference to the long term mean sea level at Newlyn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a point of reference, one typical scale for rainfall is\n",
    "\n",
    "| rainfall | classifier |\n",
    "|:--------:|:----------:|\n",
    "| less than 2 mm per hour  | slight |\n",
    "| 2mm to 4 mm per hour | moderate |\n",
    "| 4mm to 50 mm per hour | heavy |\n",
    "| more than 50mm per hour | violent |\n",
    "\n",
    "although for flood risk both intensity and total quantity are factors. River levels vary naturally, but significant changes in water level and high existing states are both risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `stations.csv` file contains additional information on the stations reporting data in the previous two files, namely the station name, latitude and longitude, as well as maximums, minimums and 95% data limits for the river stage measurements. More information is available via the Environment Agency API at a URI in the form\n",

    "https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/id/stations/{stationReference}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of risk\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project flood risk is defined by combining both probability of a flooding event and the impact of an event (for which property value is a proxy). You may use a risk score defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R := 0.05 \\times (\\textrm{total property value}) \\times(\\textrm{flood probability}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential additional considerations are the number of households impacted and the extent of the local area in which flooding appears likely.\n"

    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop a Python program with two main features: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ability to clasify flood risk for UK postcodes & locations based on a subset of labelled data.\n",
    "2. The ability to visualize and analyse rainfall data in conjunction with the above tool to present risk information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we describe the functionality that we would like you to incorporate into these features. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tool must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert between UK ordnance survey easting/northing coordinates and GPS latitude & longitude\n",
    "2. Provide at least one classifier/regression for postcodes in England into a ten class flood probability scale based on provided labelled samples.\n",
    "3. Provide a regression tool for median house price for postcodes in England, given sampled data.\n",
    "4. Provide a cregression tool & classifier taking in an arbitrary location and predicting the Local Authority and flood risk.\n",
    "4. Calculate a predicted risk for input postcodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class method interfaces for this core functionality has been specified in the skeleton `flood_tool` package. These core intefaces will be used during the automated scoring run during the week, and should only be updated if requested by an instructor.\n"
