# Modern Programming Methods
## Assessment 1: Cellular Automata

In this programming exercise, you will create a Python module file providing implementations of several simple cellular automata.

See [assessment.pdf](./assessment.pdf) for the full formal exercise definition.

A starter file, `automata.py` is provided and should be updated with your code. A starter test framework is available in the `tests` folder.

__Reminder: This is an individual assessment.__

Although students are encouraged to discuss the problem background and coding techniques with their peers, you should not allow other students to examine your code, nor attempt to view the code of others. In cases of doubt, students may be examined on their submission via oral assessment.

If you use any non-Imperial websites during the course of this assessment, please list them in `References.md`

#### Suggested Workflow

You are recommended to work using a code editor such as VS Code, rather than working in Jupyter notebooks and copying material back and forth. Your work should be uploaded to GitHub before the submission deadline. For this we recommend using either:

- A `git` based GUI such as GitHub Desktop
- The source control tab in VS Code
- The `git` tool on the command line. If no additional files have been created, then this can be achieved by running:
  ```bash
  git add -u
  git commit
  git push -u origin main
  ```
  If you have created additional files to be submitted (e.g. additional code tests) then these should be staged using commands such as `git add tests/test_pents.py` before committing.

#### Submission deadline

The final version of your module should be submitted via your GitHub Classrooms repository by 4pm BST on Friday 14th October 2022.

To avoid technical issues, please try to upload versions of your work regularly as you go.
