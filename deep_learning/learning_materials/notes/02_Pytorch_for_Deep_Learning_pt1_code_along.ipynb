        "In this introduction to PyTorch for deep learning, we will dive into certain packages and utilities of the library made to facilitate data handling and training opertations. We will explore similar concepts that were seen in the previous lectures, but in a different way. We will specifically focus on the functions of ``Dataset`` and ``Dataloader`` objects and their roles, also exploring adjacent functionlities for data splitting, pre-processing, and analysis. We will also discuss the basic training workflow and how ``PyTorch`` integrates these different steps. We must consider that ``PyTorch`` is an extensive library, and these lectures are designed to introduce you to its main concepts, particularly the ones that are useful for the completion of this module. With the links and references below, we encourage you to further explore the library as you see fit.\n",
