    "What is missing is a way to efficiently solve linear system with this data structure. We could attempt to use standard LU Decomposition (Gaussian Elimination). But the computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, making this method infeasible for very large sparse system. The issue is that standard LU decomposition does not take into account that most elements of a matrix are zero. There are different ways to overcome this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sparse direct solvers**. Sparse direct solvers are essentially variants of LU decomposition, but tuned for taken into account that most of the matrix consist of zero elements. Sparse direct solvers are highly efficient for PDE problems in two dimensions and still very good for many three dimensional problems. However, there performance deteriorates on matrices arising from complex three dimensional meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Methods**. The most widely used iterative solvers are based on so-called Krylov subspace iterations. The idea is that the matrix is only known through its actions on vectors, that is we are allowed to use matrix-vector products only. A sequence of matrix-vector products is then used to build up a low-dimensional model of the matrix that can be solved efficiently and well approximates the solution of the original large linear system. Iterative methods are widely used in applications and can give almost optimal complexity in the number of unknowns. However, the problem is that the performance of iterative methods depends very much on certain properties of the matrix that reflect the underlying physical problem and so-called preconditioning techniques often need to be used to accelerate iterative solvers. These preconditioners can themselves be complex to develop for specific applications and are a topic of much research.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multigrid Methods**. Multigrid methods follow a different idea. Here, starting from our discretisation we move to coarser ans coarser discretisation levels to refine the solution. Eventually, we are on a very coarse level on which the solution is trivial to accomplish. From there we refine again. Multigrid can be used as solver on its own or as preconditioner for iterative methods.\n"
