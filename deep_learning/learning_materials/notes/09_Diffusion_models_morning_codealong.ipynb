This is a *very* difficult thing to do for an artificial neural network. It is also a *very* difficult and unnatural thing for a biological neural network to do. For instance, when an author writes a novel, or an artist creates a painting, they do so by gradually refining it over many iterations. Rarely will an author or artist produce their final creation with one train of thought! This observation is the core inspiration behind diffusion models, a (relatively) new type of deep generative model. \n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","Many of the important limitations of VAEs and GANs can be considered a consequence of the aforementioned difficulty in generating data samples with a single network evaluation. VAEs optimise a surrogate loss that is only an *approximation* of maximum likelihood training. This has practical negative consequences on the quality of the generated outputs. Meanwhile, the adversarial training scheme used to optimise GANs is [notoriously unstable](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498). It is also often unfaithful to the true data distribution ([mode collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02163)). In truth, the generator doesn't (directly) care about learning a representative model of the data distribution, so long is it can fool the discriminator.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","Diffusion models have the potential to circumvent these issues. They benefit from a stable training scheme, and can generate very high quality samples that are competitive with (and now often surpass) those produced using GANs. This is not to say diffusion models are a perfect silver bullet solution, and they certainly have important limitations of there own.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","*“All models are wrong, but some are useful”* - George E. P. Box.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","A single pass through a diffusion model will likely produce samples that are *“wrong”* and typically much worse than that produced by a VAE or GAN. However, diffusion models are designed to be *“useful”* over many hundreds or thousands of iterations (and network evaluations). A negative consequence of this is that using diffusion models for inference is considerably more computationally expensive than a VAE or GAN, which only require a single pass through the network.\n","\n","<br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A5kMlxhPmQ9Q"},"source":["#### **The results speak for themselves**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"23Gs6zlwna6l"},"source":["**Imagen**\n","\n","Developed by Google Research, Brain Team.
