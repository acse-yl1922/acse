It is conventional to define the cross-sectional area of the expanding cloud of fragments as $A = \\pi r^2$ (i.e., assuming a circular cross-section), for use in the above equations. So, the originally spherical asteroid spreads laterally, flattening into a \"pancake\". Fragmentation and spreading **ceases** when the ram pressure drops back below the strength of the meteoroid $\\rho_a v^2 < Y$."

    "The figure below shows a typical solution to the above set of equations for an impact airburst scenario. The kinetic energy loss per unit height, which is a good approximation for the energy transferred to the atmosphere as heat (and is often referred to as the energy deposited per km altitude), is shown as a function of altitude. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/airburst.png\" width=\"640\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario the asteroid experiences breakup at approximately 48-km altitude (denoted by the star), before spreading and decelerating rapidly until an altitude of approximately 15 km at which point the **peak energy loss per unit height is maximum**. This point is often considered to be the **burst altitude**. The **total kinetic energy lost** by the asteroid at this point is a good estimate of the **airburst energy** (i.e., the total energy deposited into the atmosphere) for hazard analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact scenarios with a burst altitude above the surface can be considered to be **airburst events**. Many airburst events do not form a sizable crater on the ground, because even if a substantial fraction of the original asteroid survives to the ground it will be decelerated to a very small fraction of its initial speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact scenarios with a burst altitude below the surface (i.e., peak energy deposition per unit height is not reached before the asteroid strikes the ground) will form a sizable impact crater on the ground and can be considered as a **cratering event** (although a sizable proportion of the original kinetic energy of the asteroid may be transferred to the air).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some more complex scenarios where a **low altitude airburst combined with a substantial crater-forming event** is likely. This regime is not well understood and for simplicity we will **not consider it here**.\n",

    "For airbursts, we will take the total kinetic energy lost by the asteroid at the burst altitude as the burst energy $E_k$. For cratering events, we will define $E_k$ as the **larger** of the total kinetic energy lost by the asteroid at the burst altitude or the residual kinetic energy of the asteroid when it hits the ground.\n"
